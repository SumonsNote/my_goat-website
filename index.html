            <p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he domestic goat or simply goat is a domesticated species of
                goat-antelope typically kept as livestock. It was domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and
                Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily Caprinae, meaning it
                is closely related to the sheep.</p>

            <h2>We love each other and. I love my goat very much</h2>
            <p>Neuroscience tells us that many animals possess the physiological attributes needed to enable them to
                experience love, if defined as ‘feelings of strong affection for a particular individual’. Research
                shows that the ‘cuddle hormone’ oxytocin is heightened in dogs when they are interacting with their
                owners, which increases bonding. Paired prairie voles stay together thanks to the ‘desire’ hormone
                dopamine, which they are more receptive to after mating. Behaviourally we see animals displaying
                extraordinary evidence of grief, care and empathy towards each other and their human companions – this
                clearly isn’t just ‘cupboard love’! If they could talk, I believe they absolutely would say they can and
                do love.</p>

            <h1>Animals is the another ummah like human being</h1>
            <h2>Anyone who has no feelings for animals has a dead heart</h2>
            <p>If love is life’s greatest mystery, then perhaps its second-greatest mystery is whether humans are alone
                in experiencing it. We talk about lovebirds and puppy love, but biologists are cautioned against
                anthropomorphizing their animal subjects and assigning human traits and meaning where they don’t belong.
                Instead, scientists scan brains, measure hormone production and conduct “speed dating for pandas,” all
                of which could help answer the question, “Do animals fall in love?” And if so, how, and why?</p>

                <p>One day, two goats try to cross a weak and narrow bridge across the river. The goats are at either
                    end of the bridge, but neither is ready to make way for the other. They come to the centre of the
                    bridge and begin fighting about who should cross first. As they fight mindlessly, the bridge gives
                    in, taking both the goats down into the river with it.His best-known novel in the west, One Part
